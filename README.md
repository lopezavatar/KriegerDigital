Optional 1:

Scenarios that are not covered in this test are:

Inputting invalid emails such as:

Only numbers,
Only letters,
Invalid characters,


All of these combinations should be tested and automated
since they do not represent a valid address.

Optional 2:

The website 
https://www.hoeffner.de/login
seems to block emails from 
YopMail and MailDrop domains thus 
this part couldn't be efficiently automated.
